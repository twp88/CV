####Junior Full Stack Web Developer

I have just graduated from Makers Academy, the best coding bootcamp in Europe which is built on the foundations of TDD, XP, pair programming and above all Agile.

Having teetered on the abyss of a lifetime of TEFL drudgery, mixed with the ecstasy of travelling for six years, I decided to put my mind to more constructive and challenging pursuits. Emerging from this chrysalis of international travel as a trilingual sensual butterfly with well honed communicative skills (try teaching the third conditional to a non native speaker), I chose to investigate turning my part time hobby of coding into something more renumerable and professional.

My ideal role would be as a Full Stack Junior Developer in a place that embraces these concepts, in a communicative and open environment.


####I do what I love

 Having always looked for a profession which is challenging, creative and intellectually stimulating, other professions have left me wanting in the past. Coding is something which ticks all of these boxes but also has the potential for being a force for good in the world, considering it's global reach and impact on peoples daily lives. For this reason I would like to be an advocate for morally written code, focussing on projects which will, at the very least, "do no evil" as google used to say. Added to which, I love writing code.


## Skills

#### Communication

The common thread of all of the different jobs that I have done is communication.

+ Coding at Makers Academy requires you to collaborate on nearly every single line you right over a four month period. From pair programming to group project work, the agile principles that Makers evangelises means it is imperative that you know and learn how to communicate first and write code second.

+ I gave several talks at teacher conferences about the adoption and use of technology in the classroom in order to aid and not inhibit teaching. 

+ While co-authoring the publication "Funbook" (Difusion/Pons idiomas 2015) I had to co-ordinate the tasks of co-planning and writing with my co-author and editors.

+ As a teacher, I had to simplify the task of communicating and explaining complex grammatical concepts to people whose first language is not English.

+ Working as a sales rep in a 4D cinema in Barcelona I had to deal with customer expectations and issues using three different languages in a difficult and hectic environment.
