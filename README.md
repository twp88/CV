####Junior Full Stack Web Developer

I have just graduated from Makers Academy, arguably the best coding bootcamp in Europe which is built on the foundations of TDD, XP, pair programming and above all Agile. My ideal role would be as a Full Stack Junior Developer in a place that embraces these concepts, in a communicative and open environment.

Having teetered on the abyss of a lifetime of TEFL drudgery, mixed with the ecstasy of travelling for six years, I decided to put my mind to more constructive and challenging pursuits. Emerging from this chrysalis of international travel as a trilingual sensual butterfly with well honed communicative skills (try teaching the third conditional to a non native speaker), I chose to investigate the posibility of turning my part time hobby of coding into something more renumerable and professional.



####I do what I love

I have spent a large part of my adult life searching out and looking at the different career possibilities that might suit me best. It is fair to say that I have tried a wide variety in my pursuit for something which is both rewarding and intellectually challenging as well as being creative. Coding is something which ticks all of these boxes but also has the potential for being a force for good in the world, considering it's global reach and impact on peoples daily lives. For this reason I would like to be an advocate for morally written code, focussing on projects which will, at the very least, "do no evil" as google used to say.


## Skills

#### Communication

Throughout my professional life I have done a wide variety of jobs, which have all had the common thread of requiring good communicative skills in order to flourish. While co-authoring the publication "Funbook" (Difusion/Pons idiomas 2015) I had to co-ordinate the tasks of co-planning and writing with my co-author and editors. As a teacher, I had to simplify the task of communicating and explaining complex lingustical concepts to people whose first language is not English. Working as sales rep in 4D cinema in Barcelona
