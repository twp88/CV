####Junior Full Stack Web Developer

I have just graduated from Makers Academy, the best coding bootcamp in Europe which is built on the foundations of TDD, XP, pair programming and above all Agile.

Having teetered on the abyss of a lifetime of TEFL drudgery, mixed with the ecstasy of travelling for six years, I decided to put my mind to more constructive and challenging pursuits. Emerging from this chrysalis of international travel as a trilingual sensual butterfly with well honed communicative skills (try teaching the third conditional to a non native speaker), I chose to investigate turning my part time hobby of coding into something more remunerable and professional.

My ideal role would be as a Full Stack Junior Developer in a place that embraces these concepts, in a communicative and open environment.


####I do what I love

 Having always looked for a profession which is challenging, creative and intellectually stimulating, other professions have left me wanting in the past. Coding is something which ticks all of these boxes but also has the potential for being a force for good in the world, considering it's global reach and impact on peoples daily lives. For this reason I would like to be an advocate for morally written code, focussing on projects which will, at the very least, "do no evil" as google used to say. Added to which, I love writing code.


## Skills

#### Communication

The common necessity of all of the different jobs that I've done is the ability to communicate.

+ Coding at Makers Academy requires that you to collaborate on nearly every single line you write over a four month period. From pair programming to group project work, the agile principles that Makers evangelises means it is imperative that you know and learn how to communicate first and write code second.

+ While co-authoring the publication "Funbook" (Difusion/Pons idiomas 2015) I had to co-ordinate the tasks of co-planning and writing with my co-author and editors, not to mention working together to create the concept of the book in the first place.

+ As a teacher, I had to simplify the task of communicating and explaining complex grammatical concepts, or training students to pass exams in order to gain places at universities, or places of work. Non of these people spoke English as a first language, and many of them could only communicate in the most elementary ways.

+ Working as a sales rep in a 4D cinema in Barcelona I had to deal with customer expectations and issues using three different languages in a difficult and hectic environment.

+ I gave several talks at teacher conferences about the adoption, adaptation and use of technology in the classroom in order to aid and not inhibit teaching. Many of these talks were directed at people who had problems indentifying the on button of a computer.


#### Adaptability

From teaching to book writing, sales and retail to voice acting and programming, all across four different countries, three languages and two continents and in the space of three years, I have had to learn to adapt.

Each job, task, country or culture has posed it's own unique challenges. Be it the Spanish tax system or Australian visa rules, soothing the feathers of disgruntled Catalan customers or preparing my students for the potential of hazards of a New Zealand earthquake (or Tsunami), each situation that I have faced in the past three years has required that I adapt and learn fast.
